The Predicting the Relation of Authors and their Publications using DBLP Data project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the 
relationship between authors and their publications using data from the DBLP database. The DBLP database is a comprehensive digital library that indexes 
research publications in the field of computer science. The project will involve parsing the DBLP data, which will include extracting features such as 
author names, publication titles, and publication dates. The dataset will then be used to train and test the machine learning model, which will employ 
advanced algorithms such as network analysis to predict the relationships between authors and their publications. The outcome of this project will be a 
highly accurate and reliable model that can be utilized to predict the relationship between authors and their publications in various fields of research. 
The project is developed using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn.
